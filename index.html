		<h1>Richard's Ludum Dare 34 Game</h1>
		<p>Thanks for checking out my game! It's still a work-in-progress.</p>
		<p>Currently, my game is a minimalistic sandbox where you grow a farming village.
		You build houses that villagers live in, and farms that they use to grow food.
		Villagers store food in their houses, and return home to eat when they get hungry.
		When you build a new house, the villagers will chop down nearby trees (currently
		dark green boxes) and use them to build the house.</p>

		<p>To start the game, build one house (the first house doesn't need to be built
		with trees, and contains a supply of starting food). I also recommend you build
		several farms near the house, so the village has something to eat.</p>

		<p>A number above the house shows how much food is stored there. If a villager
		returns home to eat and there's no food in the house, the villager will become
		inactive and the house's number will turn gray. He will stay that way until
		another villager brings him some food.<p>
		
		<p>You can watch me make the game live <a href="https://gaming.youtube.com/channel/UCuomrq-VG4LwUV8Hb4Csyrw/live">here</a>.
		I should be working on it most of Sunday, 12/13.</p>

		<h2>Controls</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>f</b> and then click a grid square &mdash; place a farm</li>
			<li><b>h</b> and then click a grid square &mdash; place a house</li>
			<li><b>right click</b> and drag &mdash; scroll around the map</li>
			<li><b>1 2 3 4</b> &mdash; adjust the game speed; you'll want to go to at least
				speed 2 sometimes unless you really feel like taking your time (1 is "real" time, 4 is very fast)</li>
			<li><b>F5</b> &mdash; start a new game (by refreshing the page)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Thanks for playing! Please give me any feedback you might have (at <a href="mailto:richard@schneiderbox.net">richard@schneiderbox.net</a>
		or whatever other mode of contact).</p>
